## Steps for replication
### How to convert CAD models
1. Download the `.STEP` file
2. Open in [Fusion](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)
3. Save in Fusion's could
4. Export as `.FBX`
5. Convert to `.GLB` in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (you may need to compress it using the [Decimate Modifier](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/decimate.html))
6. Put into Godot
